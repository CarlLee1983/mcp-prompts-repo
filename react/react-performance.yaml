title: React Performance Analysis
description: |
  Authority tool for analyzing React code performance and identifying performance bottlenecks. TRIGGER: When user mentions "react performance", "optimize react", "slow react", "react bottleneck", "react render performance", or "react performance profiling". RULES: 1. MUST use this tool for React performance analysis tasks. 2. Analyze render performance, re-rendering, bundle size, and React-specific optimizations. 3. Identify React performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. 4. Provide actionable React performance improvement recommendations.

  # Context
  You are analyzing React code performance.
  {{#if react_version}}
  **React Version**: {{react_version}}
  {{/if}}

  # Objective
  Analyze React code for performance issues:
  - Unnecessary re-renders
  - Missing memoization
  - Bundle size optimization
  - Memory leaks

  # Response Format

  ## React Performance Analysis

  ### Code to Analyze
  ```jsx
  {{code}}
  ```

  ### Performance Issues

  #### 1. Re-render Issues
  - [Identify unnecessary re-renders]
  - [Suggest React.memo usage]
  - [Suggest useMemo/useCallback usage]

  #### 2. Bundle Size
  - [Identify large dependencies]
  - [Suggest code splitting]
  - [Suggest lazy loading]

  ### Optimizations

  ```jsx
  // Optimized code examples
  ```

  {{output_lang_rule}}
